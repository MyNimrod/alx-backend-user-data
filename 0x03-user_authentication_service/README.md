## 0x03-user_authentication_service

### user.py

In this task you will create a SQLAlchemy model named User for a database table named users (by using the mapping declaration of SQLAlchemy).

The model will have the following attributes:

id, the integer primary key
email, a non-nullable string
hashed_password, a non-nullable string
session_id, a nullable string
reset_token, a nullable string

### db.py

In this task, you will complete the DB class provided below to implement the add_user method.

"""DB module
"""
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.orm.session import Session

from user import Base


class DB:
    """DB class
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a new DB instance
        """
        self._engine = create_engine("sqlite:///a.db", echo=True)
        Base.metadata.drop_all(self._engine)
        Base.metadata.create_all(self._engine)
        self.__session = None

    @property
    def _session(self) -> Session:
        """Memoized session object
        """
        if self.__session is None:
            DBSession = sessionmaker(bind=self._engine)
            self.__session = DBSession()
        return self.__session
Note that DB._session is a private property and hence should NEVER be used from outside the DB class.

Implement the add_user method, which has two required string arguments: email and hashed_password, and returns a User object. The method should save the user to the database. No validations are required at this stage.

=======================================
In this task you will implement the DB.find_user_by method. This method takes in arbitrary keyword arguments and returns the first row found in the users table as filtered by the method’s input arguments. No validation of input arguments required at this point.

Make sure that SQLAlchemy’s NoResultFound and InvalidRequestError are raised when no results are found, or when wrong query arguments are passed, respectively.

Warning:

NoResultFound has been moved from sqlalchemy.orm.exc to sqlalchemy.exc between the version 1.3.x and 1.4.x of SQLAchemy - please make sure you are importing it from sqlalchemy.orm.exc

=============================================
In this task, you will implement the DB.update_user method that takes as argument a required user_id integer and arbitrary keyword arguments, and returns None.

The method will use find_user_by to locate the user to update, then will update the user’s attributes as passed in the method’s arguments then commit changes to the database.

If an argument that does not correspond to a user attribute is passed, raise a ValueError.
